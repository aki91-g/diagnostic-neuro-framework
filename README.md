#  [ARCHIVED] ABIDE analysis prototype
Re-directed to: [ABIDE-rdoc-analysis](https://github.com/aki91-g/ABIDE-rdoc-analysis)

## Overview
Connectome visualization of AAL atlas datasets from ABIDE with MNE/Nilearn.

## Why Archived
The initial data fetching logic was redundant and misaligned with the ultimate goal. While the code successfully achieved atlas-based connectivity visualization, it deviated from the intended dimensional approach using ABIDE database. Realized that a more scalable and streamlined pipeline is essential to bridge the gap between image data and latent variable modeling.

## Key Achievement
Successfully extracted and visualized connectomes from AAL atlas-defined ROIs.
